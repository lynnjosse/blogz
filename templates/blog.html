<!-- for loop where we loop through the objects and pull up the titles
and posts.  Each title is also a link to the individual post page for that 
post, which is called by putting its id in a query string as part of the url,
so something like: -->


{% for blog in blogs %}
<a href = '/blog?id={{blog.id}}')> <h2>{{blog.title}} </h2></a>
<p>{{blog.body}}</p>
<br/>
{% endfor %}
